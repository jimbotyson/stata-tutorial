# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

These tutorials assume no knowledge of R but do assume that you are comfortable using a computer with a modern user interface (for example Windows, MacOs, GNU/Linux with Ubuntu), and that you will be happy typing commands in a console or a script. You will also need to learn how to navigate a folder or directory tree.

## Software Requirements

This tutorial has been tested using [recent versions of R and RStudio.](R version 4.2.2 (Innocent and Trusting) has been released on 2022-10-31.)  Please ensure that your applications are up to date.

## How to use these materials

### The Larger Exercises

The most important learning experiences in this offering is the two pat **larger exercises**, each of which covers a reasonably coherent subset of the material.  You should complete the **Part I** exercise after you have learned about basic graphing and **Part II** when you have learned about regression modelling.  

They are designed to be completed by learners in pairs. A pair has two roles: the driver, who sits at the active console and types code into a file or command prompt; the navigator, watches the driver and reviews code as it written makes suggestions and possible corrections, and who researches (using Google for example) solutions as problems arrive.  You should **swap** roles every 15 minutes or so. 

After the learners work on one of the exercises, the solution script should be presented, and a round table discussion of problems encountered and alternative solutions should take place.

### General advice

Test all the code you see. Some of the code is written to be added to a script and you should develop a single script for all sections since some of the later material will assume that you have run earlier example code. Sometimes the tutorial suggests that you run a command on the console or command line and you should do so. Don't add commands intended for the console to your script - they may cause your script to break and fail.

Code to be executed and run by you looks like this:

    type this at the console and hit return
    or add it to a script and run the script

Generally the tutorial will be explicit about when you should add code to a script.

As the series progresses, I will provide less explicit detail in my instructions.  You will move from 

    type these characters and hit return
    
to

"The R command for a one way anova is `aov(y~x)`.  Use this command to test the mean of `boodpressure` by `ethnicity`"
