# Simple graphs

Demonstrate live lots of simple graphs.  

Be sure to show that issuing a graph command destroys a currently open graph window unless you use the named() option:

```
hist english, named(english)
hist history, named(history)

which ensures that the new graphs are opened in new tabs in the open graph window.
```
